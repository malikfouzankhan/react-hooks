:: Why React?
While everything we do in React can technically be done in plain HTML, CSS and JS. React allows:
    - Better code reuse
    - Large-scale performance in production
    - Clean separation of concerns via components
    - Easier maintenance and testing

:: Folder Structure
Industry Standard Folder Layout:
    src/
     |-- components/    # Reusable UI components
     |-- pages/         # Page-specific components
     |-- utils/         # Constants, helpers and mock data

:: .jsx vs .js - Which one for components?

✅ use .jsx for files containing JSX
    const MyComponent = () => {
        return <h1>Hello, JSX</h1>;
    };
    export default MyComponent;

Pros of .jsx:
    - Clarity: indicates the presence of JSX
    - Better editor support (highlighting, linting)
    - Matches community convention

⚠️ You can use .js but...
Cons:
    - ❌ Misleading for JSX-containing files
    - ❌ May confuse older tooling
    - ❌ Less expressive in files lists

    ✅ Best Practice:
    Use .jsx for components
    Use .js for utilities, config and non-JSX logic

:: Importing files in React

You can import like this:
    import Header from "./components/Header.jsx     // you can skip the extension

    Note: The .jsx extension is optional while importing

🧠Constants and static data

❌ Don't keep large static data or hardcoded strings inside components.
✅ Instead, extract to utils/

    // utils/constants.js
        export const CDN_LINK = "https://cdnlink.com";
        export const URL = "https://suhail.app";

    // utils/mockdata.js
        const data = [
            {
                // complete large dataset
            }
        ];

        export default data;

💡Export tips
Named exports
        export const CDN_LINK = "https://cdnlink.com";
        export const URL = "https://suhail.app";

        import {CDN_LINK, URL} from "../utils/constans";

Default exports
        export default data;

        import data from "../utils/mockdata";

📏 File Size Guidelines
In companies like Uber, file length best practices:
    - 🚫 Avoid files longer than 100 files
    - ⚠️ If you exceed that, refactor into smaller components or files
